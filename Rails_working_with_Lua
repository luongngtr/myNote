STEP 1: Install rails on Windows
Refer to the following link
http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/installing-rails-5-windows

STEP 2: Deploy a rails project
Suppose that the rails project is given by a zip file
Unzip this file in somewhere, for example, E:\BPL_HOMEPAGE_RAILS
Modify the file E:\BPL_HOMEPAGE_RAILS\app\config\environments\production.rb by adding the following lines
config.secret_key_base = 'hellohowareyouiamfinethankyouandyou'
config.serve_static_files = true

STEP 3: Run the rails server
Open cmd in window and run the following lines
> cd /d E:\BPL_HOMEPAGE_RAILS
> bundle install
> bundle exec rake assets:precompile
> bundle exec rake db:create
> bundle exec rake db:migration
> rails server -p 80 -b 0.0.0.0 -e production


Note that for the development (fixing bugs), instead of "production", we run
> rails server -p 80 -b 0.0.0.0 -e development
